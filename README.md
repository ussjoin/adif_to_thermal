# ADIF to Thermal

Utility (in development) to provide a continuous feed on a thermal printer of contacts logged. In theory, any program that saves ADIF files should be compatible; I'm testing with WSJT-X, but feel free to submit bug reports for other programs and I'll see what I can do.

Currently very hacker-grade code (e.g., hard-coded paths) but I'm working on it actively. If you care about this code, let me know and it'll bubble up in my queue.
